MagicMirror
===========

The super magic interface of my personal Magic Mirror. More information about this project can be found on my [blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror).

Runs as a php script on a web server with basically no external dependencies. 

Modify js/config.js to change some general variables (language, wather location, compliments, news feed RSS) and calendar.php to add your own ICS calendar.

Edit trains.js to edit the train journey you will need to know.
